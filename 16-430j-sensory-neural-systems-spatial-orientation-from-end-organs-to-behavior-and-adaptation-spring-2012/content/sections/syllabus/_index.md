Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course introduces sensory systems, and multi-sensory fusion using the vestibular and spatial orientation systems as a model. Topics range from end organ dynamics to neural responses, to sensory integration, to behavior, and adaptation, with particular application to balance, spatial disorientation, posture and locomotion under both terrestrial and space conditions. Depending upon the background and interests of the students, advanced term project topics may include spatial disorientation, vestibular and spatial orientation modeling, flight simulator cueing system design, astronaut adaptation, artificial gravity, motion sickness, navigation, vestibular-cardiovascular responses, vestibular prostheses, or other relevant topics of interest.

Listeners may attend, provided that they read the papers, assist in presentations, and participate in discussions.

Class Format
------------

Students typically discuss two papers each week, followed by a special topic presentation by faculty:

*   45 minute paper #1 presentation
*   15 minute discussion
*   45 minute paper #2 presentation
*   15 minute discussion
*   10 minute break
*   40 minute presentation/discussion by faculty on specialty topic
*   5 minute introduction to next topic
